<br>
The sketch shows two cylindrical tanks interconnected with a pipe which has a valve that creates a constant resistance to flow of R<sub>f</sub> when fully open. The height of liquid (of density œÅ) in the first tank is h<sub>in</sub> and the second tank h<sub>out</sub>. The cross-sectional area of the first tank is A<sub>in </sub>m<sup>2</sup> and the second tank A<sub>out</sub> m<sup>2</sup>. The flow rate through of liquid through the valve is given by Where: Q = flow rate in m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> P<sub>in</sub> = pressure due to height of liquid in first tank (P<sub>a</sub>) P<sub>out</sub> = pressure due to height of liquid in second tank (P<sub>a</sub>) a) Produce a mathematical model of the process to determine the change in height of fluid in the second tank when the valve is open. b) Determine the time constant for the system.
